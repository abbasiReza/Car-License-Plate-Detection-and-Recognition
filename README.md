# Car License Plate Detection and Recognition

## Description

This project detects and recognizes car license plates from images using YOLOv7 for detection and OCR for plate number recognition.

A synthetic dataset is generated by compositing license plate images onto different backgrounds with data augmentations.

YOLOv7 is trained on this dataset to detect license plates. The detected plates are passed to an OCR model to extract the license number text.

## Dataset 

- License plates cropped from real images
- Variety of background images without plates
- Plates composited onto backgrounds with variations in scale, rotation, illumination etc.

## Object Detection

- YOLOv7 model used for detecting license plate regions
- Trained on synthetic dataset for several epochs 
- Evaluated on test set for mAP metrics

## License Plate Recognition

- OCR model from PyTesseract used to recognize license text
- Recognized text saved along with detection results

## Usage

The pipeline detects plates and extracts license numbers from new images.

Could be integrated into applications like surveillance, toll booth monitoring etc.
